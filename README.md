# Recipe Book React App

## Description

### Version 1

Simple React app with React-bootstrap components and json-server.

You can read, add, delete and search for recipes.

### Version 2

Still Simple React app with React-bootstrap components and json-server.

You can read, add, delete and search for recipes.
Added dark/light mode and different themes to choose from using context.

NOTE: Code for the context has a lot of comments to help me understand better what each line does and also to have somewhere to return to if I ever forget how to use it. :sweat_smile: :shushing_face:

## To start the project

For version 1, after you download and unzip the repository, in the project directory:

1. Open one terminal and run:

### `npm install`

To install node modules in the directory

2. In the same terminal run:

### `json-server --watch ./data/db.json`

Runs json-server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. Open one more terminal and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
